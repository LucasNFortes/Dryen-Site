            <p>Focused on results, I believe that people, processes and tools
              tools coexist so that great things can be accomplished.
            <p>
            <p>Throughout my career I have worked with countless
              professionals with whom I was able to evolve as a person and as a professional, acquiring new knowledge as
              new challenges are
              new challenges are proposed, whether as a technician in the execution of the
              activity or as a leader in strategic planning, I believe that
              each individual needs to have self-discipline and self-responsibility,
              but without giving up teamwork and collaboration.</p>
            <p>Honor, respect, diversity of opinions, are the guidelines for a good interpersonal and professional good
              interpersonal and professional coexistence.</p>
